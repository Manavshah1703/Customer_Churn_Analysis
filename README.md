# Customer Churn Analysis Python Project

## Description
This project analyzes customer churn data to identify patterns, predict churn, and provide actionable insights to reduce customer attrition using Python.

## Dataset
- Customer information, subscription details, and usage metrics.  

## Libraries Used
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

## Features / Analysis
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand customer behavior
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Feature engineering for churn prediction
4. Visualization of churn trends and key metrics
5. Predictive modeling using classification algorithms
6. Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC curve)

## How to Run
1. Install required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run `main.py` or open notebooks in `notebooks/` folder

## Results
- Identified key factors contributing to churn
- Built models to predict high-risk customers
- Provided actionable insights for customer retention
